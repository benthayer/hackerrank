### Very few people have solved any of these problems. I've solved several.

This repo is for some of the advanced problems that I've solved on hackerrank

### Order of my percieved difficulty
1. Sum of Maximums
2. Spies, Revised
3. Determining DNA Health
4. Circular Palindromes

### Interesting information for each problem.

### Descriptions of each problem
[Sum of the Maximums][sums] - top 11% - [my code][my-sums]<br/>
Given a long array and many queries, preprocess the array and create an efficient search algorithm.

[Spies, Revised][spies] - top 3% - [my code][my-spies]<br/>
Harder variation of the (NP-Hard) N-Queens Problem. Use a heuristic algorithm to quickly find a solution.

[Determining DNA Health][dna] - top 6% - [my code][my-dna]<br/>
Given scores for a set of "genes", build a data structure that can efficiently compute scores for strings and varying subsets of the genes.

[Circular Palindromes][pals] - top 12% - [my code][my-pals]<br/>
Efficiently compute data on transformations of the same input.
