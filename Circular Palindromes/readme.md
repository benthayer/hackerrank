This is my solution to the hackerrank Circular Palindromes problem
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/circular-palindromes/problem

I am the 217th person to solve this problem, and I did not use the other solutions as a reference. I thought that many of the other solutions were difficult to understand, but I think my solution is somewhat straightforward.

palindromes_v0.cpp is my first attempt. I started redesigning the code and decided to move it to a new file, palindromes.cpp. Since I started modifying it, the code in v0 works for most, but not all test cases.

The code in palindromes.cpp runs about 15x faster.
